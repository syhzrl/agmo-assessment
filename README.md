# Personal Feedback

- Very good exercise to do after working with frameworks for so long. Going back to classic html, css and js is very refreshing.
- Would personally use ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white) because personally I think its the fastest and most efficient way to style ui in the current technology sphere.
